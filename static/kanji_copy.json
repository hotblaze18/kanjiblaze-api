The last question in the game show match is the following: \"What is the capital of Japan.\" The triceratops and the wolverine scream the correct answer at the same time: とうきょう!","additionalR":"Hints\nWow, that was a pretty easy answer to get right. とうきょう is what pretty much everyone would guess, and they'd be correct.","On’yomi":["とう"],"Kun’yomi":["あ"],"mainReading":"とう","Nanori":"None"},{"type":"kanji","cardNo":576,"cardLevel":5,"cardBody":"図","cardMeaning":["Diagram"],"meaningMnemonic":"The treasures are in the mouth where there’s ice.

It isn't even pretty green grass, it's a little brown and damaged from the sun.","readingMnemonic":"The grass on top is brown and burned from the sun, so you need to take a cool saw (くさ) and hack the tops off. The saw is actually physically cool to the touch, to help heal the grass' sunburned bits. It just happens to look cool too.","additionalR":"Hints\nImagine using your cool saw to saw off the heads of all of this grass. You made the cross pretty big, so there is a ton of grass to get through.

So you have to ride a horse, so break out that old saddle and go visit your parents.","additionalR":"Hints\nClose your eyes and imagine being on a saddle, heading back to your hometown right now.

It's not particularly good looking land, but it'll do, and it's already full of seeds, so that's pretty good.
